# Installing

To set up both projects (Next.js and Vue):

```bash
npm install
npm run init
```

---

# Development

To run both projects simultaneously:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development servers for both **Next.js** and **Vue** projects.

---

# Linting, Formatting, and Testing

Each project has its own set of commands for linting, formatting, and unit testing.

**Lefthook** is configured to automatically run the necessary hooks on every commit to check for:

- Linting
- Formatting
- Unit testing
- E2E testing

Additionally, you can manually run all tests with:

```bash
npm run test
```

This will run all the tests for both projects.
